# wlu-schedule-builder - Under Construction

This is a [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) script that will generate a student's schedule as calendar events.
All that the student will have to do is run the script and enter their LORIS username and password and add the .ics file to their calendar.

This script is currently under construction and may manifest as a website, chrome extension, and/or a desktop/mobile app.

A template for building similar scripts can be found [here](http://code-epicenter.com/how-to-login-to-twitter-using-casperjs-and-phantomjs-and-extract-tweets/).
